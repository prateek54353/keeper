## 🚀 Installation & Setup (For Developers)

To get a local copy of Keeper up and running for development and testing, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   **Flutter SDK:** [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (Stable channel recommended).
*   **Firebase CLI:** [Install Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install_the_firebase_cli). If you use `npm`, ensure Node.js and npm are installed:
    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```
*   **Android Studio / VS Code:** With Flutter and Dart plugins installed.
*   **Google Account:** Required for Firebase project and Google Sign-In setup.

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prateek54353/keeper.git
cd keeper
```

### Firebase Project Setup

Keeper uses Firebase for authentication and data storage. You'll need to set up your own Firebase project:

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Click "Add project" and follow the steps. Link it to your Google Cloud project `keeper-c767f`.

2.  **Enable Firebase Services:**
    *   In your Firebase project, navigate to "Build" -> "Authentication" -> "Sign-in method" and enable **"Email/Password"** and **"Google"**.
    *   Navigate to "Build" -> "Firestore Database" and create a database. Choose a starting security rule (e.g., "Start in test mode" for quick setup, but **update rules for production**).
    *   Ensure the **Google People API** is enabled in your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/people.googleapis.com/overview?project=120371881170).

3.  **Configure Android App (for your mobile build):**
    *   In Firebase Console, go to "Project settings" -> "Your apps".
    *   Add an Android app. Enter your `package_name` (e.g., `com.dev.keeper` from `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`) and your SHA-1 fingerprint.
    *   Download `google-services.json` and place it in `android/app/`.

4.  **Configure Web App (for your web build):**
    *   In Firebase Console, go to "Project settings" -> "Your apps".
    *   Add a Web app. Give it a nickname (e.g., "Keeper Web").
    *   **Crucially**, note down the `appId` from the Firebase configuration snippet provided after registering the web app.

5.  **Update Firebase Configuration in Code:**
    *   Open `lib/main.dart` and locate the `FirebaseOptions` for `kIsWeb`.
    *   Update the `appId` with the one you obtained from the Firebase Console (e.g., `1:120371881170:web:890416038feee6bb27390b`).
    *   The `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, `storageBucket`, and `messagingSenderId` should align with your project's details (e.g., from `android/app/google-services.json` or your Firebase Console).

### Google Cloud Console Setup (for Google Sign-In)

For Google Sign-In to work on your web app, you need to configure "Authorized JavaScript Origins" in the Google Cloud Console:

1.  **Go to Google Cloud Console Credentials:**
    *   [Google Cloud Console -> APIs & Services -> Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
    *   Select your project `keeper-c767f`.

2.  **Edit OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application):**
    *   Locate and click on your "Web client" (e.g., "Web client (auto created by Google Service)").

3.  **Add Authorized JavaScript Origins:**
    *   Add the following URIs under "Authorized JavaScript origins":
        *   `http://localhost:XXXXX` (replace `XXXXX` with the port Flutter serves your app on during local development, typically `52742`).
        *   `https://prateek54353.github.io` (This is your base domain for GitHub Pages).
    *   **Important:** Do NOT include any paths (like `/keeper/`) or trailing slashes in these origins.
    *   Save your changes.

4.  **Verify Client ID in `index.html`:**
    *   Ensure your `web/index.html` has the correct Google Sign-In Client ID in the meta tag:
        ```html
        <meta name="google-signin-client_id" content="120371881170-io0ohi23jcf38ev7fhledaibk9gib43a.apps.googleusercontent.com">
        ```

### Install Flutter Dependencies

After cloning and setting up Firebase:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## ▶️ Usage / How to Run

### Running Locally (Android/Desktop)

To run the app on a connected Android device, emulator, or desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux):

```bash
flutter run
```

### Running Locally (Web)

To run the web app in your browser for development:

```bash
flutter run -d web-server
```
The app will be served at `http://localhost:<PORT_NUMBER>`.

### Automated Build & Deploy Script (Windows)

For streamlined building of your Android APK and deploying the web app to GitHub Pages, use the `deploy_keeper.bat` script:

1.  **Navigate to your project root** in Command Prompt.
2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    deploy_keeper.bat
    ```
    The script will:
    *   Build the Android APK (`arm64-v8a` release).
    *   **Prompt you to enter the destination path** for the APK.
    *   Build the web app for GitHub Pages (`--release --base-href /keeper/`).
    *   Copy the built web files to the `docs/` folder.
    *   Add, commit, and push these changes to your `main` branch on GitHub.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

The `deploy_keeper.bat` script automates the build and copy to `docs/` and the Git push. After running the script:

1.  **Configure GitHub Pages:**
    *   Go to your GitHub repository: [https://github.com/prateek54353/keeper](https://github.com/prateek54353/keeper)
    *   Navigate to **Settings** -> **Pages**.
    *   Under "Source," select `main` branch and the `/docs` folder.
    *   Click "Save."

2.  **Access Your Live App:**
    Your app will be live at: `https://prateek54353.github.io/keeper/` (allow a few minutes for deployment).
